### My personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website that I'm creating using just React and CSS, without any other technologies and Three.js and GSAP to present my complete Tech Stack for potential clients. 

I just wanted to try and make a good functioning and visually pleasing website using React, since I earned a certificae from Meta where I obviously learned React.

# Technologies used:

- React
- CSS
- Three.js (in progress)
- GSAP (in progress)

# Content:

- App.js
- navbar.js
- aboutme.js
- techstack.js
- portfolio.js (in progress)
- contact.js (in progress)

- languageProvider.js (lifting the state of the language up, so it can be used by every component)

- pictures

- symbols
